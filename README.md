# My Atom
[Atom.io](https://atom.io/) is my favorite editor. Casually I use **Sublime Text**
> Soon I will publish my settings and packages for the **Sublime Text**.

- For the syntax theme I use [Cobalt2-Atom](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-atom).
- I'm currently using [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/) for a font.
- I made some modifications to the [stylesheet](https://github.com/3runoDesign/my-Atom/resource/styles.less) of my Atom.

## Packages
Coming soon.

## How Install

```shell
#Cobalt2-Atom
apm install cobalt2-syntax
```
```shell
#Install all packs | Coming soon.
```
